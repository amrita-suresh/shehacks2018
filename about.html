            You’re a woman and you enter your workplace -- it’s just a normal
            day at work, but something about the setting is very abnormal. You
            notice you’re one of the few women there. Or, you notice that your
            boss, just like most of your previous bosses, is a man.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s tiring and exhausting, and eventually you’re dangerously close
            to feeling that strangely sad sensation of acceptance.
          </p>
          <p>
            But little do you know, you’re a part of the 60% of undergraduate
            degree holders.
          </p>
          <p>
            You consist of 59% of the entry-level workforce and 80% of the
            American consumer population.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your worth and potential is limitless -- but it’s just hard to see,
            because of the vicious cycle of underrepresentation. You sometimes
            feel daunted or limited because it seems that you’re alone, and so
            the cycle continues. It’s time to destroy the cycle of
            underrepresentation and show the world the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
