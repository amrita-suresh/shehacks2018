          <p class="quote"><i>“A ship in port is safe, but that's not what
            ships are built for.” --Grace Hopper</i></p>
          <p>Grace Murray Hopper (<a href="https://www.biography.com/people/grace-hopper-21406809">biography.com</a>)
            was a leader in the field of computer science and mathematics, as
            well as a rear admiral in the U.S. Navy. She attended Vassar College
            as a young adult and later earned a Ph.D. in mathematics at Yale --
            a very difficult task for women at the time. However, her most
            inspiring and groundbreaking accomplishments involve making code
            accessible to other people.
          </p>
          <p>It wasn’t an easy task at the time -- user interface didn’t exist
            (<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/do-you-know-grace-hopper/">digitaltrends.com</a>).
            Computers were very primitive, and so were people’s views regarding
            them. At one point, Hopper described how many people were
            frustrated by her insistence on communicating with computers
            using English rather than complex code. Hopper’s persistence and
            grit carried her through, nevertheless, and the world’s first
            working compiler was born. Entirely driven by the spirit of
            inclusivity, Hopper knew she wanted to ensure that the process
            of writing code wouldn’t be unfathomable to most people -- and
            it paid off
            (<a href="https://www.space.com/34885-grace-hopper-biography.html">space.com</a>).
          </p>
          <p>Although Hopper was raised during a very eventful and tumultuous
            period in women’s rights history, she realized her dream of
            spreading the use of code through the creation of useful tools
            such as compilers. Now, she’s permanently embedded in history as
            one of the most prominent and brilliant women in technology and
            science, she has earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she
            earned the rank rear admiral during her career with the Navy.
