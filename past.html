          <h4>Grace Hopper</h4>
          <p class="quote"><i>“A ship in port is safe, but that's not what
            ships are built for.” --Grace Hopper</i></p>
          <p>Grace Murray Hopper (<a href="https://www.biography.com/people/grace-hopper-21406809">biography.com</a>)
            was a leader in the field of computer science and mathematics, as
            well as a rear admiral in the U.S. Navy. She attended Vassar College
            as a young adult and later earned a Ph.D. in mathematics at Yale --
            a very difficult task for women at the time. However, her most
            inspiring and groundbreaking accomplishments involve making code
            accessible to other people.
          </p>
          <p>It wasn’t an easy task at the time -- user interface didn’t exist
            (<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/do-you-know-grace-hopper/">digitaltrends.com</a>).
            Computers were very primitive, and so were people’s views regarding
            them. At one point, Hopper described how many people were
            frustrated by her insistence on communicating with computers
            using English rather than complex code. Hopper’s persistence and
            grit carried her through, nevertheless, and the world’s first
            working compiler was born. Entirely driven by the spirit of
            inclusivity, Hopper knew she wanted to ensure that the process
            of writing code wouldn’t be unfathomable to most people -- and
            it paid off
            (<a href="https://www.space.com/34885-grace-hopper-biography.html">space.com</a>).
          </p>
          <p>Although Hopper was raised during a very eventful and tumultuous
            period in women’s rights history, she realized her dream of
            spreading the use of code through the creation of useful tools
            such as compilers. Now, she’s permanently embedded in history as
            one of the most prominent and brilliant women in technology and
            science, she has earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she
            earned the rank rear admiral during her career with the Navy.

          <h4>Brit Marling</h4>
          <p class="quote"><i>“Nothing seemed as scary as waking up at 40 and
            realizing that I had not lived a very courageous life.”
            --Brit Marling</i></p>
          <p>The media industry is a known battleground for women’s rights and
            equality, and Brit Marling is one of its leaders, seizing control
            of her career. In Highschool she described herself as an
            overachieving nerd, who wanted to be class president and head of
            the newspaper
            (<a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/story/brit-marling-the-oa-netflix">wmagazine.com</a>).
            After graduating as valedictorian
            (<a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/brit-marling">interviewmagazine.com</a>) with a
            degree in economics at Georgetown University, Brit Marling interned
            at Goldman Sachs, prior to turning down a full time job offer.
            Instead, she decided to move to Hollywood to make movies with more
            realistic and honest representations of women than what was already
            present. She refused small roles in films offered to her with the
            goal of writing her own films. She says,"I think about things my
            little sister has to deal with, the struggle it is to be a young
            girl in this world, and it makes me determined to play interesting
            women. I have a hard time being a part of, or even thinking about,
            an image system that has oppressed women.”
            (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/28/brit-marling-the-east-connundrum">theguardian.com</a>)
          </p>
          <p>Marling’s films have featured at Sundance, and she’s currently
            working on a netflix show called, “The OA.” Writing and directing
            her own work also allows her to cast interesting and unique women
            in different roles, who may not have received the role otherwise.
            Phyllis Smith, for example, had a role tailored for her in the show.
            Marling particularly enjoys writing science fiction, as she
            appreciates the opportunity it presents to portray metaphors about
            life in a manner that’s easy to consume
            (<a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/brit-marling">interviewmagazine.com</a>).
          </p>
          <p>Marling still believes there’s a lot to be done, and feels that
            the gender gap can sometimes be heartbreaking -- yet, she continues
            to invest herself in her work and pour her heart and soul into her art.

          <h4>Fe Del Mundo</h4>
          <p class="quote"><i>“I feel that if you give the world the best that
            you can, the best will always come back to you.” - Fe del Mundo</i>
          </p>
          <p>Fe del Mundo (1911-2011) was a Filipino pediatrician and the
            first woman to enroll at Harvard Medical School, 13 years before
            it began accepting women. Harvard officials didn’t realize she was
            a woman until she arrived there in 1936 to begin her studies, but
            they allowed her to stay because of her incredible academic record.
            (<a href="http://www.amazingwomeninhistory.com/fe-del-mundo/">amazingwomeninhistory.com</a>)
            For del Mundo, this was nothing new, since she had been defying
            odds throughout her life.
          </p>
          <p>Deeply affected by the loss of four of her seven siblings to
            various disease, she decided to study pediatrics. Despite
            extensive postgraduate study in the United States, even on the
            brink of World War II, del Mundo declined invitations to work in
            the US and returned to the Philippines to apply her studies at home.
          </p>
          <p>During World War II, del Mundo was commended for expanding the
            women’s and children’s ward, saving hundreds of lives. She also
            designed a laundry basket incubator for rural families, ran
            immunization campaigns, and taught medicine for over 30 years.
            But in 1957, del Mundo accomplished her ultimate dream: opening
            up a children’s hospital. She had to sell her own house to keep
            it afloat, but as she said, “the satisfaction derived from guiding
            and serving children is worth much more than a check.”
            (<a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/55128/pcij-dr-fe-del-mundo-a-woman-of-many-firsts/story/">
              gmanetwork.com</a>)
          </p>
          <p>With her talent, she could have made millions in America, but Fe
            del Mundo never lost sight of her roots. Even in the face of
            tragedy and danger, she continued serving her people instead
            of prioritizing personal wealth and power. And in the end, she
            changed the world in ways that really mattered.

          <p class="quote"><i>"If you are a lawyer, and you want to take on
            easier cases, you can prosecute traffic violations or something.
            You’d have a very high rate of success, and you probably could
            sleep more easily at night. But that’s not what drives me. I want
            to work on cases that I feel the most passionate about."
            --Amal Clooney</i></p>
          <p>Would you be surprised to know that when one searches up
            “Amal Clooney,” all the primary articles presented by Google are
            about her style and looks? While Amal Clooney does rock her
            personal style, she is still so much more than that. She currently
            works as a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, and specializes in
            public international law and human rights. Previously, she worked
            as a defense attorney at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York, where
            she helped to represent former Enron executives and other
            corporate clients. In her time, Clooney has represented
            several high-profile individuals such as Julian Assange, and
            former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Additionally,
            she also fought for the Elgin Marbles to be returned to Greece,
            and worked to free three Al-Jazeera journalists imprisoned in Egypt.
            (<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/incredible-life-international-human-rights-lawyer-amal-glooney-george-clooney-a7908651.html">
              independent.co.uk</a>)
          </p>
          <p>The media often reports her accomplishments with infatuation over
            her looks. Her greatest achievements are downplayed when people
            see her simply doing her job as a bonus to looking nice, instead
            of the other way around.
            (<a href="http://time.com/3687871/amal-clooney-fashion-robes-turkey/">time.com</a>)
            Regardless, Amal Clooney works hard to defend the marginalized
            communities she serves and does so whether or not she is styling a
            nice hairdo or not. She recently told BBC News, “There is lots of
            my work that takes place behind closed doors that is not ever seen.
            I think if there are more people who now understand what’s happening
            about the Yazidis and ISIS, and if there can be some action that
            results from that, that can help those clients, then I think it’s a
            really good thing to give that case the extra publicity that it may
            get.” Clooney is aware of this power she has over the media with her
            looks, and she tries to make the best of an unfortunate situation
            by trying to bring attention to what really matters.
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, Clooney is well known in the field of international
            law for advocating on behalf of exploited groups. “If you are a
            lawyer and you want to take on easier cases, you can prosecute
            traffic violations or something. You’d have a very high rate of
            success, and you probably could sleep more easily at night,” she
            said in January 2016. “But that’s not what drives me. I want to
            work on cases that I feel the most passionate about.”
